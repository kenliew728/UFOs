# **UFO - The Truth is Out There** #
## *Overview*

The purpose of the project is create a webpage with dynamic table, where it allows user the option to filter multiple criteria concurrently in the documented UFO sightings. 

## *Results*
The webpage by default will display all documented UFO sighthings in a table format. To narrow down to specific criteria, users are allow to narrow down the search with the following criteria:
1. Date
2. City
3. State
4. Country
5. Shape

Here is an example of the default display when the user first enter the webpage.

To begin the filtering process, user will need to fill in at least one criteria and press the enter key. In the example below, a user has enter "1/10/2010" as a search criteria and the table is  displaying only the results with the specified date.

To search for more than one criteria, all a user need is to enter multiple search criteria in any of the filter search option. In the example below, a user has entered "1/10/2010" in date criteria and "ca" in state criteria. The table is displaying the results based on two criteria.

## *Summary*
The drawback of this webpage is the users are only allow to enter one search option per criteria. For example, if  users wants to search with a range of date or multiple countries, the webpage will not allow them to do so. 

To further improve the user experience, each filter search option can have a drop down list that allow user to pick the available criteria. For example, a search for shape will be easier if a user can browse through a list of available shape description. 

Another improvement is to allow user to enter more then one option per search criteria. For example, allowing user to enter more than one state option or more than one country option.
